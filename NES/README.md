# Try it yourself

If you want to try this mapper, here's what you'll need:

- a custom version of [Mesen2](https://brokestudio.fr/rainbow/emulators/mesen) or [FCEUX](https://brokestudio.fr/rainbow/emulators/fceux) supporting the Rainbow mapper
- a [rainbow NES boiler plate](https://github.com/BrokeStudio/rainbow-nes-boiler-plate) (using cc65) - optional
- the above documentation
- there's also a [chat demo](https://github.com/BrokeStudio/rainbow-chat) available

## Notes

- custom FCEUX version doesn't support all the mapper features yet
- custom Mesen2 version doesn't support secured TCP protocol
