# Try it yourself

If you want to try this mapper, here's what you'll need:

- a custom version of [Blastem](https://brokestudio.fr/rainbow/emulators/blastem) supporting the Rainbow mapper
- a [rainbow Mega Drive / Genesis boiler plate using SGDK](https://github.com/BrokeStudio/rainbow-mega-drive-genesis-boiler-plate) (using sgdk) - optional
- the above documentation
- there's also a [chat demo](https://github.com/BrokeStudio/rainbow-chat) available
