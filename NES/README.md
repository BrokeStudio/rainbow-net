# Try it yourself

If you want to try this mapper, here's what you'll need:
- a [custom version of FCEUX](https://brokestudio.fr/rainbow/fceux) supporting the Rainbow mapper
- a [rainbow NES boiler plate](https://github.com/BrokeStudio/rainbow-nes-boiler-plate) (using cc65) - optional
- the above documentation
- there's also a [chat demo](https://github.com/BrokeStudio/rainbow-chat) available
